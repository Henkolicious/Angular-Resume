# Resume
<p>In progress, experimental with the goal to learn Angular.</p>
<p>Now also included Material Design Bootstrap (MDB) for funsies.</p>

## Done
Most parts are done. Currently hosted at <a href="https://henriklarsson.eu" target="_blank">https://henriklarsson.eu</a>

## TODO
<p>Mediaquerys in IE on lower resolutions.</p>
<p>Remove Material Design Bootsrap (MDB) since it's only used for the navbar.</p>

* Might replace it with googles Material Design navbar.

## Setup
```
git clone <repo_link>
npm i
ng serve --open
```
Live server will start at localhost:4200<br>
Also setup an IIS (or any other dev-server with PHP installed) on localhost:4203 and target the "PHP API" folder.
